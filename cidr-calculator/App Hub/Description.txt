CIDR Calculator 

The CIDR Calculator enables CIDR network calculations using IP address, CIDR mask (subnet mask), mask bits, maximum required IP addresses and maximum required subnets.

Results of the CIDR calculation provide the wildcard mask, for use with ACL (Access Control Lists), CIDR network address (CIDR route), network address in CIDR notation and the CIDR address range for the resulting CIDR network.

For classful subnets, please use the IP Subnet Calculator. For classful supernets, please use the IP Supernet Calculator. For simple ACL (Access Control List) wildcard mask calculations, please use the ACL Wildcard Mask Calculator.
